Arrange tiles horizontally, vertically or in a grid. Resize tiles by dragging splitter bars. Tabs and links can be dragged to open in other tiles. Supports multiple tiled layouts. Works with tab groups.","fullDescription":"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVersion 13.3 - Fully compatible with Multiprocess Firefox [e10s]\n  • Minor bug fixes to eliminate error mesages in browser console.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are looking for a simpler 'split browser' add-on, then please try Tile View\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTile Tabs allows tabs to be displayed in tiled layouts within the Firefox tabbed browser content area. In each tiled layout, tiles can be arranged horizontally, vertically or in a grid, and tiles can be re-sized by dragging splitter bars. Tabs and links can be dragged to open in new or existing tiles. The scrolling of tiles can be synchronized. A tiled layout can display tabs from more than one Firefox tab group.\n\nThe Firefox tabbed browser paradigm is fully maintained. Tiled layouts are achieved by presentational changes rather than functional changes. All features (menu commands, url bar, search bar, tabs buttons) continue to operate as normal.\n\nLayouts can be created and tabs can be tiled individually above, below, left or right of the active tile. Tiles are arranged in groups - where all the tiles in a group have the same width or same height - and all the tiles in a group are separated by splitters all with the same orientation (horizontal or vertical). Tiles can be displayed with a tab button for each tile - or with a single tab button for each layout.\n\nIndividual layouts can be saved, opened, deleted or set as the default layout. In addition, all of the currently open layouts can be saved as a single Multi-Layout.\n\nTiling is performed using Menu Commands, Keyboard Shortcuts or Drag-and-Drop of tabs and links.\n\nThe major features of the Tile Tabs user interface are illustrated in the above screenshots.\n\nUsers migrating from Tile View, please refer to the Notes for Tile View Users section below.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo get started, create a default layout by clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon or by pressing F12.\n\nSwitch between the tiled view and the normal browser view by clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon again or by pressing F9.\n\nAlternatively, try tiling two specific tabs using menu commands:\n\n    • Select the first tab to be tiled by clicking on its tab button.\n    • Click Tile on the main menu bar or app menu.\n    • Select Tile Tab on the sub-menu.\n    • Select the direction - Above, Left, Right or Below.\n    • Select the second tab to be tiled.\n\nClose the layout by double-clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon or by pressing F12.\n\nTHINGS TO TRY\n\nDrag-and-Drop tiling of tabs - to make tiling quicker - just Shift+Drag a tab or link:\n\n    • For further details see the Drag-to-Tile Shortcut section below.\n\nAutomatic assignment of tabs - for a different browsing experience - enable these options:\n\n    • Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nUSER REFERENCE\n\nTiles and Splitters\n\nA tile can be made the active tile by clicking on the corresponding tab button or by clicking on the tile's contents. A tiled tab is indicated by a colored border around the tab button icon. The active tile is indicated by a colored border around the tile contents. The highlighting of tiled tabs can be changed to use colored text and/or italic text on the tab buttons. A different tab can be displayed in the active tile by doing Shift+Click on the tab button.\n\nA tile can be re-sized by dragging the adjacent splitter bars. Splitter bars will snap into position when near to the edge of a tile or another splitter bar. Splitter bars will also snap in line with other splitter bars anywhere in the tiled layout.\n\nDouble-click on any splitter to equalize the size of all the tiles in that group. Ctrl+Double-click on any splitter to equalize the two tiles on each side of the splitter. Shift+Double-click on any splitter to expand the smaller of the two tiles on each side of the splitter.\n\nTab Selection\n\nA tab is selected by clicking on the tab button in the tabs bar. By default, when in tiled view, selecting a tiled tab displays the tiled layout, and selecting an untiled tab displays the tab normally. Alternatively, there is an option (Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected) to always display the tiled layout when in tiled view. This option automatically assigns the selected tab to the active tile, if the selected tab was previously untiled.\n\nThe way that tab selection works can be temporarily changed using the Assign Tab mouse shortcut (see below).\n\nThe tooltips for tiled tab buttons show both the layout name and the web page URL.\n\nLayout Commands\n\nThere are four layout commands which appear on the main menus:\n\n    • New Layout - creates a pre-defined layout with two, three, four or all tabs or using the default layout.\n    • Recent Layout - quickly opens a recently used layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    • Close Layout - closes the the active layout and all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n    • Close All Layouts - closes all layouts all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n\nand seven more layout commands which appear on the Manage Layouts submenu:\n\n    • Open Layout - opens a previously saved layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    • Save Layout - saves the active layout and optionally the assigned tabs, pinned states, scroll/tab locks and layout color.\n    • Delete Layouts - deletes previously saved layouts (multiple layouts can be selected).\n    • Configure Layout - configures the name and color of the active layout.\n    • Set Default Layout - sets the default layout to be used by the toolbar button and on start-up.\n    • Import Layouts - imports previously exported layouts from a text file.\n    • Export Layouts - exports previously saved layouts to a text file (multiple layouts can be selected).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or from the Tile View button menu on the toolbar.\n\nThe New Layout command always assigns the currently selected tab to top-left tile in the layout, and automatically creates and assigns new blank tabs to the other new tiles. The All Tabs submenu items create a layout containing all of the previously untiled tabs. There are options to assign existing tabs to new tiles in preference to creating new tabs, and to load the homepage into new tabs.\n\nThe Open Layout and Recent Layout commands reinstate tiled tab pinned states and scroll/tab locks (if any). The Open Layout and Recent Layout commands can also be used to open a Multi-Layout, which opens all of the individual layouts saved in the Multi-Layout.\n\nThe Close Layout and Close All Layouts commands automatically close any blank tabs created by New Layout that have not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Save Layout command requires a layout name which cannot be null and can only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and spaces. There are checkboxes to save tabs, save pinned states, save scroll/tab locks and to save the layout color. There are also checkboxes to save all of the currently open layouts as a single Multi-Layout and to save the individual layouts in the order of their first tabs on the tab bar.\n\nThe Set Default Layout command sets the default layout as a layout with two tabs or all tabs, or as a previously saved layout. This allows the default layout to be set to any layout that can be created using the New Layout command or tiling commands.\n\nTiling Commands\n\nThere are eight tiling commands which appear on the main menu, on the toolbar button menu and on the context menu:\n\n    • Tile Tab - adds an existing tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile New Tab - opens a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Tile Link in New Tab - opens a link in a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    • Assign Tab - replaces the tab displayed in the currently active tile with another (tiled or untiled) tab.\n    • Untile Tab - removes a tile and the assigned tab reverts to normal operation.\n    • Expand Tile - expands a tile and collapses all the other tiles in that group.\n    • Show Properties - shows a popup with the tab title and tab group for the active tile (see Properties Popups section).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar, or from the context menus after right-clicking on a tab or a tile's contents.\n\nThe Assign Tab command assigns a different tab to be displayed in the active tile. If the chosen tab is already tiled in another tile (possibly in another layout), then the existing tab in the active tile and the chosen tab are interchanged.\n\nThe Untile Tab command automatically closes the assigned tab if it was a blank tab created by New Layout and has not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Expand Tile command can be used repeatedly on the same tile to alternately expand the tile horizontally and vertically - and when the tile is already fully expanded to reinstate the original layout and tile dimensions.\n\nFor convenience, a Close Tab command can also be added to the content context menu.\n\nMode Switches\n\nThere are two mode switches which appear on the main menu:\n\n    • View Tiled - toggles between the tiled layout view and the normal browser view.\n    • Sync Scroll - toggles synchronized scrolling of tiles on or off.\n\nThese switches can be can be toggled from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or appmenu, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar.\n\nSync Scroll (when ticked) synchronizes horizontal and vertical scrolling within each group of tiles. It allows easy comparison of two or more similar web pages. Any initial scrolling offset between the contents of the tiles in a group is maintained. There is an option to synchronize scrolling only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n\nView Tiled (when not ticked) shows the normal browser view with every tab displayed at at full size. It allows normal browsing in any of the tabs without closing the tiled layouts.\n\nOptions Command\n\nThe Options command appears on the main menus and gives access to the Tile Tabs Options dialog where all options settings can be configured (see Options section below).\n\nSplitter Commands\n\nThere are five splitter commands, three of which allow tiling adjacent to an existing group of tiles:\n\n    • Tile Tab - adds an existing tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Tile New Tab - opens a new tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    • Equalize Group - equalizes the size of all the tiles in the highlighted group.\n    • Equalize All - equalizes the size of all the tiles in all of the groups.\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the context menu after right-clicking on a horizontal or vertical splitter bar.\n\nThe highlighted group of tiles is indicated by a dashed colored border around each of the tiles in the group.\n\nToolbar Button\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can be added to the toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar, selecting Customize..., and dragging the button onto the toolbar. The Tile Tabs button is automatically added to the toolbar on initial installation.\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can invoke immediate actions (by clicking on the icon) or display a drop-down menu (by clicking on the down arrow).\n\nClicking on the Tile Tabs button creates a default layout if there is no existing layout, and thereafter switches between the tiled view and the normal browser view.\n\nMiddle-clicking on the Tile Tabs button either creates a new default layout or closes the active layout.\n\nDouble-clicking on the Tile Tabs button closes all layouts.\n\nThere are options to re-configure all of the Tile Tabs button actions.\n\nProperties Popups\n\nA properties popup can be shown for the active tile using the Show Properties command. A properties popup displays the tab title and tab group name for the tab assigned to the underlying tile. Clicking on the main body of a properties popup will make the underlying tile active. Shift+Clicking on the main body of a properties popup will assign the tab in the underlying tile to the active tile.\n\n\nA properties popup also displays three buttons:\n\n    • Assign Tab - assigns a different tab to the underlying tile.\n    • Scroll Lock - prevents the contents of a tile being scrolled.\n    • Tab Lock - prevents the tab assigned to a tile being changed.\n\nWhen a scroll lock or tab lock is infringed, a properties popup appears with the relevant lock button highlighted in red.\n\nThere are options to automatically show properties popups when the mouse enters the active and inactive tiles, and to automatically fade out the display of properties popups after a few seconds. There is also an option to change the width of the properties popups.\n\nWorking With Tab Groups\n\nTile Tabs is fully integrated with Firefox's tab group (Panorama) functionality. Tiled layouts can contain tabs from more than one tab group, but may be restricted to tabs from the current tab group. However, this restriction will be ignored when tabs are moved between tab groups in the Panorama window.\n\nThe tab lists in the Tile Tab and Assign Tab commands show all tabs in all tab groups. The tabs in the current tab group are shown at the top of the list above the first menu separator. The tabs in other tab groups are shown further down the tab list, with each tab group delimited by a menu separator. There is an option for tab lists to only show the tabs in the current tab group.\n\nA tab in a tiled layout that is not in the current tab group will be indicated by a dotted colored border around the tile contents.\n\nAutomatically Activating Tiles\n\nThere is an option to allow tiles to be automatically activated when the mouse enters (moves over) a tile.\n\nIt is still possible to move the mouse over other tiles without changing the active tile by holding down a configurable modifier key (Shift, Ctrl or Alt). This is useful when accessing the Tile menu on the main menu bar or app menu, or when accessing the Tile Tabs button on the toolbar, or when the Sync Scroll with wheel only when mouse over active tile option is enabled.\n\nRenaming Tabs With Layout Name\n\nThere is an option to rename all of the tiled tabs in a layout with the layout name, and another option to rename the browser window with the layout name if a tiled tab selected. The layout name can be changed using the Configure Layout command.\n\nShrink-to-Fit Zoom\n\nA Shrink-to-Fit zoom feature is provided both for individual tiled tabs and for all tiled tabs in a layout.\n\nThere are four control key shortcuts:\n\n    • Ctrl + < - shrinks the web page in the selected tiled tab to fit the tile width\n    • Ctrl + < twice - shrinks the web pages in all tiled tabs in the active layout to fit the tile widths\n\n    • Ctrl + > - resets the zoom level for the selected tiled tab to the default zoom level\n    • Ctrl + > twice - resets the zoom level for all tiled tabs in the active layout to the default zoom level\n\nFunction Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are six function key shortcuts:\n\n    • New/Close Layout - F12\n    • Untile Tab - F4\n    • Expand Tile - F2\n    • Show Properties - F1\n    • Sync Scroll - F8\n    • View Tiled - F9\n\nEach function key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus a function key (F1-F12) - or can be disabled.\n\nArrow Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are three arrow key shortcuts:\n\n    • Tile New Tab - Shift+ArrowKey\n    • Tile Duplicate Tab - Ctrl+ArrowKey\n    • Activate Tile - Ctrl+Shift+ArrowKey\n\nEach arrow key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus an arrow key - or can be disabled. These shortcuts work even if there is no existing layout. There are options to disable these arrow key shortcuts when the keyboard focus is in a text box or when an untiled tab is selected.\n\nMouse Shortcuts\n\nThere are six mouse shortcuts (the default mouse action is shown):\n\n    • New/Close Layout - Double-click tab\n    • Tile Tab/Link - Shift+Drag tab/link\n    • Copy Tab - Ctrl+Drag tab\n    • Assign Tab - Shift+Click tab\n    • Open In Next Tile - Ctrl+Middle-click link\n    • Open In Prev Tile - Ctrl+Shift+Middle-click link\n\nEach mouse shortcut (except Copy Link) can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus a fixed mouse action (e.g. Click tab) - or can be disabled.\n\nNew/Close Layout\n\nDouble-click on a tab to create a new layout (if the tab is untiled) or close an existing layout (if the tab is tiled).\n\nTile Tab/Link\n\nShift+Drag a tab or link onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's or link's URL in a new tile above, left, right or below the existing tile. A label beside the cursor indicates the direction in which the tab or link will be tiled when it is dropped. The direction is determined by the position of the cursor within the existing tile (e.g. if the cursor is near the top, then the new tile will be created above). To create the first two tiles of a layout, Shift+Drag a tab or link onto the currently selected (untiled) tab's contents. A new tab is created except when an untiled tab is dragged. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nCopy Tab\n\nCtrl+Drag a tab onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's URL in the tile. A new tab is not created. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nAssign Tab\n\nShift+Click on a tab to assign the tab to the active tile. If the Assign tab to active tile when tiled tab selected or Assign tab to active tile when untiled tab selected options are enabled, then Shift+Click on a tiled/untiled tab will just select the tab (and not assign the tab to the active tile). The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nOpen In Next Tile\n\nCtrl+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"next\" tile in the group (to the right or below). If the next tile contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the last tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the first tab of the group. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nOpen In Prev Tile\n\nCtrl+Shift+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"previous\" tile in the group (to the left or above). If the previous tile contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the first tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the last tab of the group. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nStart-up and Restart\n\nTile Tabs can be configured to restore the layouts from a previous session when Firefox starts-up or restarts. After a restart, it should always be possible to restore the layouts. However, on start-up it is only possible to restore the layouts if the tabs from the previous session have been saved, which requires the Firefox option When Firefox starts: to be set to Show my windows and tabs from last time.\n\nTile Tabs can also be configured to apply the default layout when Firefox starts-up or restarts. The default layout is not applied if session restore is configured and possible.\n\nNotes For Tile View Users\n\nTo make Tile Tabs work in the same way as Tile View, three options must be enabled:\n\n    • Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    • Assign to active tile when tiled tab selected\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nOptions\n\nThe Options Dialog can be accessed from the Firefox Add-ons Manager or by selecting Options ... on the Tile menu or on the Tile Tabs toolbar button menu.\n\nThe Options Dialog allows the user to:\n\n    • Select a set of eight colors for multiple tiled layouts.\n    • Change the width of the colored border around the active tile.\n    • Automatically activate tile when mouse enters tile.\n    • Change the key that stops automatic activation of tiles.\n    • Syncronize Scroll with wheel only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n    • Change the width of the properties popup.\n    • Automatically show Properties popup when mouse enters the active and inactive tiles.\n    • Automatically fade out the display of Properties popup after a few seconds.\n    • Not to show the Tab Group name in Properties popups.\n    • Change the size of the splitters.\n    • Change the snap distance for splitters.\n    • Change the highlighting of tiled tabs (show icon, color text or italic text).\n    • Display a single tab for each layout (instead of a tab for each tile).\n    • Move all tiled tabs to left-hand side of tab bar.\n    • Rename tiled tabs with their layout name.\n    • Rename browser window with layout name if tiled tab selected.\n    • Assign untiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    • Assign tiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    • Assign another tab when tiled tab closed.\n    • Assign existing tabs to tiles in preference to creating new tabs.\n    • Assign existing tabs from right of selected/closed tab (instead of left).\n    • Load new tabs with home page.\n    • Keep selected tab when switching to tiled view.\n    • Create new tabs to fill the last row/column of a new grid.\n    • Automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n    • Show the Tile menu on the main menu bar and app menu.\n    • Only show tabs in the current tab group in tab lists.\n    • Show the Tile submenu on the tab context menu.\n    • Choose the menu items shown on the tab context menu.\n    • Show the Tile submenu on the content context menu.\n    • Choose the menu items shown on the content context menu.\n    • Change the function key shortcuts (new/close layout, untile tab, expand tile, show properties, sync scroll, view tiled).\n    • Disable the F12 Firefox shortcut for Firefox Developer Tools.\n    • Change the arrow key shortcuts (tile new tab, tile duplicate tab, activate tile).\n    • Disable the arrow key shortcuts if keyboard focus is in a text box.\n    • Disable the arrow key shortcuts if untiled tab selected.\n    • Change the mouse shortcuts (new/close layout, drag-to-tile, click-to-assign, open-in-next-tile, open-in-prev-tile).\n    • Choose whether Open In Next Tile and Open In Prev Tile open link in a new tab.\n    • Choose the commands to be performed for each of the Tile Tabs button actions (click, middle-click, double-click).\n    • Restore the layout from a previous session on start-up and after restart.\n    • Apply the default layout on start-up and after restart.\n\nThe Restore Defaults button restores all options to their original default setting.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/71/71506.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/71/71506.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"A tiled layout with six tiles."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/71/71507.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/71/71507.png?src=api&modified=1337607712","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Tiled tabs are indicated by blue borders around the tab button icons.

generated on the fly. Simply open JavaScript Deobfuscator from the Web Developer menu and watch the scripts being compiled/executed.","fullDescription":"Some websites use various tricks to prevent you from seeing the JavaScript code that runs there, often the code is downloaded from the server in obfuscated form or even generated on the fly. Or maybe the JavaScript codebase is simply too large to browse it easily. Yet the JavaScript engine still needs to know which code to run and that’s where JavaScript Deobfuscator gets its information from: it simply displays the scripts that the JavaScript engine compiles and executes. This makes it a useful tool even when working with web pages that don’t use obfuscation.\n\nHow to use JavaScript Deobfuscator\n\nOpen the JavaScript Deobfuscator window from the Web Developer menu. Now it is recording all scripts being compiled or executed. You can open a web page to see what happens while that page loads. Or you can click a button to see what code that click triggers. You can pause recording whenever you need to analyze the results and don’t want new scripts to be added. Press Ctrl+F to open the Find bar and search through the scripts.\n\nNormally, JavaScript Deobfuscator will record all JavaScript code from all tabs. You can use filters to limit it to code originating from a particular website, e.g. specify “http://example.com/” in the “Include scripts” list to only list code from example.com. It is also possible to record JavaScript code executed by Firefox itself, this code is excluded by default however. You can remove some entries from the “Exclude scripts” list to record it as well. Warning: The browser runs lots of code, recording all of it will likely cause it to hang up.\n\nNote: When the JavaScript Deobfuscator window is open all JavaScript code executes much slower. Only open it when you actually need it.\n\nLimitations\n\n    Currently no code beautification is being performed beyond what the JavaScript engine does.\n    Analyzing websites with lots of JavaScript code such as Gmail can cause the browser to hang.\n    For performance reasons filters have to be prefixes of the script locations, the filter strings will only be found at the start of the URL.\n    The profiling functionality of JavaScript Deobfuscator is very rudimentary and cannot deal with recursion.\n\n\nSource code / Contributing\n\nThe extension source code is available under https://github.com/palant/jsdeobfuscator.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/161/161156.png?src=api&modified=1436289823","width":"700","height":"234","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/161/161156.png?src=api&modified=1436289823","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"67","caption":"Devtools panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/75/75011.png?src=api&modified=1436289823","width":"484","height":"510","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/75/75011.png?src=api&modified=1436289823","thumbnailWidth":"142","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Menu item to switch on monitoring"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-deobfuscator/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/palant/jsdeobfuscator","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/332202/javascript_deobfuscator-2.0.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":45544,"developerComments":"Inspired by \"The Ultimate Deobfuscator\" (http://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Blogs/3198.aspx)","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-deobfuscator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":20,"totalDownloads":1254429,"weeklyDownloads":4862,"dailyUsers":51118,"updateDate":1438088100000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/palant/jsdeobfuscator/issues"},{"id":"firessh@nightlight.ws","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/289/289675-32.png?modified=1421792101","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/289/289675-64.png?modified=1421792101"},"name":"FireSSH","type":"extension","version":"0.94.7.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mime Čuvalo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mime-%C4%8Duvalo/?src=api"},"description":"FireSSH is a free, cross-platform SSH terminal client for Mozilla Firefox.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see .\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nCopyright (C)\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License. But first, please read\n.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/23/23519.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/23/23519.png?src=api&modified=1331247702"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sql-inject-me/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/229626/sql_inject_me-0.4.7-fx.xpi?src=api","size":130840,"developerComments":"The source is available on Github!\n\nhttps://github.com/SecurityCompass/SQL-Inject-Me","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sql-inject-me/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":13,"totalDownloads":485504,"weeklyDownloads":1176,"dailyUsers":13728,"updateDate":1382574422000,"supportURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/"},{"id":"{bb6bc1bb-f824-4702-90cd-35e2fb24f25d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/92/92079-32.png?modified=1422346435","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/92/92079-64.png?modified=1422346435"},"name":"Cookies Manager+","type":"extension","version":"1.5.2.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"V@no","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/vanowm/?src=api"},"description":"Cookies manager to view, edit and create new cookies.

Access to a detailed summery of the SSL negotiation is supplied by a toolbar button you can place in any location.

Standard HTTP unencrypted connections will turn the URL bar icon gray.\n\nThis add-on was designed to more easily show the true security state of the connection so everyone can learn more about ciphers and encryption using SSL. Firefox currently shows a green URL tag for an extended validation (EV) or a blue URL tag for a domain validation (DV) certificate and a lock icon if the connection is SSL encrypted. We did not think this was enough information to decide if the connection to the site was truly secure. This is why the \"Calomel SSL Validation\" add-on was developed.\n\nWe score the connection on the following items: if the certificate was valid, if the fully qualified host name is equal to the common name the certificate was registered for and the strength of the cipher and cipher key length.\n\nPrivacy and security are very important to us.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see .\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nCopyright (C)\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License. But first, please read\n.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/23/23520.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/23/23520.png?src=api&modified=1331247702"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xss-me/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/148902/xss_me-0.4.6-fx.xpi?src=api","size":106496,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xss-me/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":16,"totalDownloads":296319,"weeklyDownloads":600,"dailyUsers":9995,"updateDate":1337277221000,"supportURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/"},{"id":"{73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/722-32.png?modified=1432898426","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/722-64.png?modified=1432898426"},"compatibilityOverrides":[{"type":"incompatible","minVersion":"0","maxVersion":"2.6.8.999","appID":"{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}","appMinVersion":"40.0a1","appMaxVersion":"*"},{"type":"incompatible","minVersion":"2.6.9","maxVersion":"2.6.9.26rc2","appID":"{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}","appMinVersion":"41.0a1","appMaxVersion":"*"}],"name":"NoScript Security Suite","type":"extension","version":"2.6.9.35","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Giorgio Maone","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/giorgio-maone/?src=api"},"description":"The best security you can get in a web browser!\nAllow active content to run only from sites you trust, and protect yourself against XSS and Clickjacking attacks.","fullDescription":"Winner of the \"PC World World Class Award\", this tool gives you with the best available protection on the web.\nIt allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, guarding your \"trust boundaries\" against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), cross-zone DNS rebinding / CSRF attacks (router hacking), and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its unique ClearClick technology.
